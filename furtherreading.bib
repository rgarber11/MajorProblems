  abstract = {{In Intersectionality as Critical Social Theory Patricia Hill
              Collins offers a set of analytical tools for those wishing to
              develop intersectionality's capability to theorize social
              inequality in ways that would facilitate social change. While
              intersectionality helps shed light on contemporary social issues,
              Collins notes that it has yet to reach its full potential as a
              critical social theory. She contends that for intersectionality to
              fully realize its power, its practitioners must critically reflect
              on its assumptions, epistemologies, and methods. She places
              intersectionality in dialog with several theoretical
              traditions—from the Frankfurt school to black feminist thought—to
              sharpen its definition and foreground its singular critical
              purchase, thereby providing a capacious interrogation into
              intersectionality's potential to reshape the world.}},
